                <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
                <div class="list">
                    <ul>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>

                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian<br> Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed<br> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget<br> cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under<br> Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT<br> to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease<br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat<br> yields</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling<br> American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to<br> provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian<br> subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly<br> expanding population</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and<br> sorghum yields</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues<br> that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as<br> we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous<br> because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long<br> time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">2009 - dies at the age of 95.</li>
